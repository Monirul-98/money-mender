      <h2>Difference between authorization and authentication</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Ans:</b> Authorization determines what the user can access and
        Authentication verifies the user.Authorization always takes place after
        authentication and Authentication is the first step of a good identity
        and access management process.Authorization isnâ€™t visible to or
        changeable by the user and Authentication is visible to and partially
        changeable by the user.

        Why are you using `firebase`? What other options do you have to
        implement authentication?

        authentication systems are easy here.It also helping the sign-in and
        onboarding experience for end users.It provides supporting email and
        password accounts, phone auth, and Google, Twitter, Facebook, and GitHub
        login, and more.Other options i can have other than firebase are:
